# Uber Ride Data Analysis (EDA Project)

# 📌 Project Overview
  This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Uber ride booking data to understand:
     -Ride cancellations (by customers and drivers)
     -Incomplete rides and their reasons
     -Relationship between ride distance and booking value
     -Driver performance based on ratings
     -The goal is to extract meaningful business insights using data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

# 📊 Dataset Description
  The dataset contains information such as:
    -Ride Distance
    -Booking Value
    -Avg VTAT (Vehicle Time of Arrival)
    -Avg CTAT (Customer Time of Arrival)
    -Driver Ratings
    -Cancellation Indicators
    -Incomplete Ride Reasons
    -Payment Methods

# 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
    -Python
    -Pandas
    -Matplotlib
    -NumPy

# 📈 Key Analysis Performed
  
  ## ✅ Data Cleaning
    -Handling missing values using mean, median, and mode based on data type
    -Removing irrelevant columns
    -Checking outliers

## ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis
    -Cancellation patterns by customers and drivers
    -Incomplete rides and their main reasons
    -Ride distance vs booking value relationship
    -Driver ratings vs cancellation reasons

## ✅ Visualization
    -Bar charts for categorical comparisons
    -Scatter plots for numerical relationships
    -Summary statistics

# 💡 Key Insights
    -Longer waiting time increases customer cancellations
    -Ride distance has a strong positive relationship with booking value
    -Incomplete rides are caused almost equally by multiple factors
    -Driver ratings show little difference across cancellation reasons

# 🚀 How to Run
    -Clone the repository
    -Open UBER.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
    -Run cells sequentially

# 📌 Conclusion
  This project demonstrates practical EDA skills including data cleaning, visualization, and insight generation to support data-driven decision making in ride-hailing services.

# ✨ This project is part of my learning journey in Data Science and Data Analysis.
